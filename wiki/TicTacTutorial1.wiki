== The Game ==

The game will be a working implementation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe Tic Tac Toe] where two players play against each other. The game has the following properties:

 * The game will only feature player against player, no AI
 * A player has to be logged in to play
 * A player has an account that counts wins, losses and ties
 * Each win earns the player points
 * The player clicks "play". This will either open a new game or match him to a already open game.
 * A player can only play one game at a time
