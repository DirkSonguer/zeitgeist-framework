#The Gamesystem is a Zeitgeist module that helps you develop games

= Zeitgeist Gamesystem =

As said in the introduction, Zeitgeist is meant not only as a generic framework for web applications but has a special focus on games, especially persistent browser based games (PBBGs).

The game specific code is located in the [http://code.google.com/p/zeitgeist-framework/source/browse/#svn/framework/trunk/modules/gamesystem Gamesystem] which is not part of the core classes but a seperate module.

= The Gamesystem module =

The Gamesystem is meant to be offer very generic methods that can be used by almost any game. It's based on the following assumptions:

 * Every user with a session is a potential player
 * Every instance of the application is a potential game ([http://www.raphkoster.com/2009/01/08/database-sharding-came-from-uo/ Sharding])
 * Every game has players
 * Every player has data that defines his condition in the game
 * Players interact with other players as well as the game world itself
 * Every interaction can be mapped to a game action (defined by the game mechanics)
 * Actions change the data associated with the players and the game world
 * Actions can be executed at any present or future time

Based on these assumptions the Gamesystems has two major duties:

 * Handle incoming actions and dispatch them at the given time (provided by the [GamesystemGamehandler Gamehandler class])
 * Handle the game specific data (provided by the [GamesystemGamedata Gamedata class])
