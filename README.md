Welcome to the Zeitgeist Framework
Zeitgeist is a PHP based multi purpose framework for web applications.

Originally developed as a framework for web based browsergames, 
Zeitgeist has since then grown into a framework for any kind of web application. 
However it's focus is still PBBG (persistent browser based games) or other 
highly pipelined applications.

The idea of Zeitgeist is not to be a full blown framework with a ton of modules 
and purposes. Instead it offers a set of very generic classes that cover a wide 
range of possibilities. With them you can develop applications in a short amount of time.

The repository contains the framework itself (including test cases) as well as 
examples and a demo application. It also includes a tool to administer and set 
up new Zeitgeist based applications which is based on the framework itself and 
doubles as a demo implementation.
