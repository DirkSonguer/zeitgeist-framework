= The Goal=

In this tutorial, we want to create a game, based on the Zeitgeist Framework. The game will be a working implementation of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe Tic Tac Toe] where two players play against each other. The game should have the following properties:

 * The game will only feature player against player, no AI
 * A player has to have an account to play
 * A player has to be logged in to play
 * Wins, losses and ties will be stored for each account
 * Each win earns the player points, which will also be stored for each account
 * The game will use a simple matchmaking pattern: The game will either open a new game or match a player to an already open game
 * A player can only play one game at a time
 * A game ends if a player wins, the game is tied or one player forfeits

As said, the game will use the Zeitgeist Framework. The game specific implementation will use the [http://code.google.com/p/zeitgeist-framework/source/browse/#svn/framework/trunk/modules/gamesystem gamesystem module].
